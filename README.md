This website is designed to help sports fans travelling to Six Nations rugby games. The tournament, which is held annually, involves six European teams who each host two or three games a year. This city guide is designed for supporters who are planning on visiting a city and help them find local ammenities, as well as the stadium itself, along with travel information and ticket purchasing links. 

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories
* As a visitor to the website, I want to:
    - Navigate around the website with ease.
    - Find and select the country/city I am planning to visit.
    - Locate country specific information which will include name and location of the stadium and links to travel information. 
    - Easy access to match day ticket bookings and flight searches.
    - View a map of the local area to the relevant stadium. 
    - Be able to view and find local ammenitites, including accomodation and where to eat and drink near the stadium. 
    - Be able to sign up for relevant news and information to do with the Six Nations tournament. 
    - View all information clearly and access it easily when I return to the website. 

## Design

The site's main goal is to provide the user with information and for the user to be able to access the information quickly. I have kept this in mind when designing the site. 

### Color Scheme
 The main color throughout the site is green (mainly [#00302b](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2300302b&oq=%2300302b&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.4496j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) as this has connotations to a field and sports pitch. This has been complemented by a dark background and white text for easy reading and to ensure the text and information stands out on the page. I have kept the color scheme quite simple as I will use flags and a Google Map on the site, which will bring a lot of color to the site. 

### Typography

The site uses two main fonts; [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton?preview.text_type=custom) and [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text_type=custom), both taken from the Google Fonts library. Anton is used for the main text of the website as it is clear and easy to read where I have used Poppins for the headings as it is a bold, strong font. 

### Imagery 

Imagery is used on the site to add color and create a more appealing site. The main landing image is an action shot from a rugby game. This image is toned slightly using a color overlay getting more dense towards the bottom. The other images used are of the nations flags. These images serve the purpose of indicating which country is currently selected and whose information is being displayed below. There is also a Google Map included in the information section which is informative, allowing the user to locate the stadium and surrounding hospitality venues. 

### Wireframes

The wireframes below were created using Balsamiq displaying how the site would appear in a basic form across three different screen sizes.
