This website is designed to help sports fans travelling to Six Nations rugby games. The tournament, which is held annually, involves six European teams who each host two or three games a year. This city guide is designed for supporters who are planning on visiting a city and will help them find local ammenities, as well as the stadium itself, along with travel information and ticket purchasing links. 

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories
* As a visitor to the website, I want to:
    - Navigate around the website with ease.
    - Find and select the country/city I am planning to visit.
    - Locate country specific information which will include name and location of the stadium and links to travel information. 
    - Easy access to match day ticket bookings and flight searches.
    - View a map of the local area to the relevant stadium. 
    - Be able to view and find local ammenitites, including accomodation and establishments to eat and drink near the stadium. 
    - Be able to sign up for relevant news and information to do with the Six Nations tournament. 
    - Access links to the official Six Nations social media pages.
    - View all information clearly and access it easily when I return to the website. 

## Design

The site's main goal is to provide the user with information and for the user to be able to access the information quickly.

### Color Scheme
 The main color throughout the site is green (Hex code: [#00302b](https://www.google.com/search?q=%2300302b&oq=%2300302b&aqs=chrome.0.69i59.4496j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)) as this has connotations to a sports pitch. This has been used mainly to give a dark background against the white text to ensure the user can read the text easily and to ensure the text and information stands out on the page. I have kept the color scheme quite simple as I will use flags and a Google Map on the site, which will bring a lot of color to the site. All buttons on the site are colored in the same way using a slightly off-white color with a touch of darkness to add a bit of texture. 
 I have red colored icons above the map to visually link the icons to the markers that appear on the map. 

### Typography

The site uses three main fonts; [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton?preview.text_type=custom), [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?preview.text_type=custom) and [Kalam](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Kalam?preview.text_type=custom), all of which are taken from the Google Fonts library. Poppins is used for the main text of the website as it is clear and easy to read. I have used Anton for the headings as it is a bold, strong font. Kalam is used for the tagline and in the fact box below the map section. This has a more conversational feel and look to it, visually seperating the fact box from the city guide information.

### Imagery 

Imagery is used on the site to add color and create an appealing backdrop. The main header image is an action shot from a rugby game. This image is toned slightly using a color overlay getting more dense towards the bottom. I have used an image of the Aviva stadium (Ireland) as the backdrop for the lower part of the website, again using an overlay but mirroring the direction of opacity. The other images used are of the nations flags. These images serve the purpose of indicating which country is currently selected and whose information is being displayed below. There is also a Google Map included in the information section which is informative, allowing the user to locate the stadium and surrounding hospitality venues. 

### Wireframes

The wireframes below were created using Balsamiq displaying how the site would appear in a basic form across three different screen sizes.

Some changes were made to the design of the site after completion of the wireframes. Firstly, an extra background image was included for the bottom half of the page to add a better visual appeal than just a simple colored background.
